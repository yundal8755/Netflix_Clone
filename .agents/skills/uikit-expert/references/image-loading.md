# UIKit image loading, caching, and downsampling in Swift

**Every decoded image consumes `width × height × 4` bytes of RAM — a single 12MP iPhone photo eats ~48 MB regardless of its 2 MB JPEG file size.** This mismatch between compressed file size and decoded bitmap size is the root cause of most image-related memory crashes in iOS apps. This guide covers the complete modern toolkit for efficient image handling: ImageIO downsampling, iOS 15+ preparation APIs, NSCache strategies, cell reuse race conditions, SF Symbols, the actor-based ImageLoader pattern, and when third-party libraries still earn their keep. All code targets Swift 5.9+ / iOS 15+ with notes on WWDC 2024–2025 updates.

## Why a 2 MB JPEG explodes into 48 MB of RAM

iOS renders images through a three-stage pipeline: **Load** (compressed bytes into a data buffer), **Decode** (CPU decompresses into a per-pixel bitmap), and **Render** (bitmap copied into the frame buffer at 60–120 Hz). The decode stage is where memory balloons. The decoded bitmap buffer is proportional to **pixel dimensions**, not file size.

The formula is straightforward:

```
Decoded memory = width × height × bytesPerPixel
```

For standard **sRGB** images, each pixel requires **4 bytes** (one byte each for red, green, blue, and alpha). A 12 MP iPhone photo at 4032 × 3024 pixels therefore consumes `4032 × 3024 × 4 = 48,771,072 bytes ≈ 48 MB`. Wide color (Display P3) images on iPhone 7+ double that to **8 bytes per pixel**, pushing the same photo to ~97 MB.

| Image source | Pixel dimensions | JPEG on disk | Decoded in RAM |
|---|---|---|---|
| iPhone 12MP photo | 4032 × 3024 | ~2–4 MB | **~48 MB** |
| iPad screenshot | 2048 × 1536 | ~590 KB | **~12.6 MB** |
| NASA high-res | 12,000 × 12,000 | ~20 MB | **~576 MB** |
| Thumbnail in a cell | 300 × 300 @3x (900px) | ~50 KB | **~3.2 MB** |

Loading 20 full-resolution photos into a scrolling grid means **~960 MB of decoded bitmaps** — well past jetsam limits on most devices. The OS responds by compressing memory (burning CPU), then killing background apps, and ultimately terminating your app with `EXC_RESOURCE_EXCEPTION`. As Apple's Kyle Sluder explained at WWDC 2018 (Session 219, "Image and Graphics Best Practices"): *"The size of this buffer in memory is proportional to the size of the input image — not the size of the image view."*

The fix is to **never decode at full resolution when displaying at a smaller size**. That's where downsampling enters.

---

## ImageIO downsampling: decode only what you display

The `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` API from the ImageIO framework is the gold-standard technique for memory-efficient image loading. Unlike `UIImage`-based resizing — which decompresses the full bitmap first, then scales — ImageIO uses **streaming I/O** to read just enough data to produce a thumbnail at the target size, never touching the full-resolution bitmap.

### ❌ Incorrect: loading full-resolution then scaling

```swift
// ❌ BAD — Decodes the ENTIRE image into memory first, then scales
let fullImage = UIImage(contentsOfFile: url.path)!          // 48 MB decoded
let renderer = UIGraphicsImageRenderer(size: thumbnailSize)
let thumbnail = renderer.image { _ in
    fullImage.draw(in: CGRect(origin: .zero, size: thumbnailSize))
}
// Peak memory: ~48 MB even though you only need a 300×300 thumbnail
```

### ✅ Correct: ImageIO downsampling

```swift
import ImageIO
import UIKit

func downsample(imageAt url: URL,
                to pointSize: CGSize,
                scale: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.scale) -> UIImage? {

    // 1. Create image source — kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false prevents
    //    decoding the full image just to read metadata
    let sourceOptions = [kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false] as CFDictionary
    guard let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithURL(url as CFURL, sourceOptions) else {
        return nil
    }

    // 2. Calculate target pixel size
    let maxDimension = max(pointSize.width, pointSize.height) * scale

    // 3. Create thumbnail at target size — only the downsampled image is decoded
    let downsampleOptions: [CFString: Any] = [
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,   // Always generate from image data
        kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true,           // Decode NOW on this thread, not lazily on main
        kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,     // Apply EXIF orientation
        kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxDimension     // Max width or height in pixels
    ]
    guard let cgImage = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(
        source, 0, downsampleOptions as CFDictionary
    ) else {
        return nil
    }

    return UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)
}
```

Each option serves a specific purpose. **`kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false`** on the source tells Core Graphics not to cache the full-resolution decoded image in memory — you only want metadata. **`kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true`** on the thumbnail forces decoding on the current (background) thread rather than deferring it to the main thread during rendering. **`kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize`** caps the longest edge; the image scales proportionally to fit. Omitting this key produces a full-size "thumbnail" — defeating the purpose entirely.

When working with in-memory `Data` instead of a file URL, swap `CGImageSourceCreateWithURL` for `CGImageSourceCreateWithData`:

```swift
guard let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(data as CFData, sourceOptions) else {
    return nil
}
```

The memory savings are dramatic. WWDC 2018 showed a grid demo dropping from **31.5 MiB** to **18.4 MiB** with downsampling. Real-world benchmarks show even larger gains: a NASA 12,000 × 12,000 image dropped from **220 MB** to **24 MB** when displayed at screen size.

## iOS 15+ preparation APIs simplify the common cases

iOS 15 introduced six `UIImage` methods that wrap ImageIO's complexity behind a cleaner interface. They fall into two categories: **full-size decode** (move decompression off the main thread) and **thumbnail** (downsample + decode in one call).

### Full-size decoding APIs

Use these when the image is already the right size but you want to pre-decode it off the main thread to avoid a hitch during rendering:

```swift
// Synchronous — call on a background queue
let decoded = image.preparingForDisplay()

// Completion handler — system manages the background queue
image.prepareForDisplay { decoded in
    DispatchQueue.main.async { imageView.image = decoded }
}

// async/await — cleanest syntax
let decoded = await image.byPreparingForDisplay()
```

### Thumbnail APIs (downsample + decode)

Use these when displaying a large image in a small view — they combine downsampling and decoding:

```swift
// Synchronous — call on a background queue
let thumb = image.preparingThumbnail(of: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200))

// Completion handler
image.prepareThumbnail(of: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200)) { thumb in
    DispatchQueue.main.async { cell.imageView.image = thumb }
}

// async/await
let thumb = await image.byPreparingThumbnail(ofSize: CGSize(width: 200, height: 200))
```

The `size` parameter is in **points**. The system multiplies by the screen scale internally. All methods return `nil` if the image is backed by `CIImage` rather than `CGImage`.

### When to pick which

| Scenario | Best API |
|---|---|
| Local image, already correct size, need background decode | `byPreparingForDisplay()` |
| Local large image, displaying in small view | `byPreparingThumbnail(ofSize:)` |
| Network data, maximum memory control, pre-iOS 15 support | ImageIO `CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex` |
| Already have a `UIImage`, quick cell configuration | `prepareThumbnail(of:completionHandler:)` |

ImageIO remains the most memory-efficient option because it works directly from compressed data without ever instantiating a full `UIImage`. The iOS 15 APIs require you to create a `UIImage` first, which may briefly touch the full bitmap. For network images where you receive raw `Data`, ImageIO is the better choice.

## NSCache: cost by decoded bytes, not file size

`NSCache` is a thread-safe, auto-evicting, in-memory key-value store — purpose-built for expensive-to-recreate objects like decoded images. The critical mistake most developers make is setting `totalCostLimit` based on compressed file size rather than **decoded bitmap size**.

### ❌ Incorrect: cost based on file size

```swift
// ❌ BAD — PNG/JPEG data size vastly underestimates actual memory
let cost = image.pngData()?.count ?? 0   // ~2 MB for a 48 MB decoded image
cache.setObject(image, forKey: key, cost: cost)
// NSCache thinks it's using 2 MB — it's actually using 48 MB
```

### ✅ Correct: cost based on decoded bitmap

```swift
final class ImageCache {
    static let shared = ImageCache()
    private let cache = NSCache<NSString, UIImage>()

    private init() {
        cache.countLimit = 100
        // 20% of physical memory, capped at Int.max
        let physical = ProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory
        cache.totalCostLimit = Int(min(physical / 5, UInt64(Int.max)))
        cache.name = "com.app.decodedImageCache"

        NotificationCenter.default.addObserver(
            forName: UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification,
            object: nil, queue: .main
        ) { [weak self] _ in
            self?.cache.removeAllObjects()
        }
    }

    func image(forKey key: String) -> UIImage? {
        cache.object(forKey: key as NSString)
    }

    func setImage(_ image: UIImage, forKey key: String) {
        let cost = Self.decodedByteCount(for: image)
        cache.setObject(image, forKey: key as NSString, cost: cost)
    }

    func removeImage(forKey key: String) {
        cache.removeObject(forKey: key as NSString)
    }

    /// Actual decoded bitmap size: bytesPerRow × height
    /// More accurate than width × height × 4 because bytesPerRow
    /// accounts for row alignment padding the system may add.
    static func decodedByteCount(for image: UIImage) -> Int {
        guard let cgImage = image.cgImage else { return 0 }
        return cgImage.bytesPerRow * cgImage.height
    }
}
```

Three details worth noting. First, `NSCache` uses **NSString** keys — using Swift `String` incurs bridging overhead on every lookup. Second, **without** `totalCostLimit` or `countLimit` set, `NSCache` will not proactively evict objects (a change since iOS 7). Third, the memory warning observer is belt-and-suspenders: `NSCache` auto-purges under memory pressure, but an explicit `removeAllObjects()` call ensures immediate release.

Setting `totalCostLimit` to **10–20% of physical memory** (the approach used by Nuke) strikes a balance between cache hit rate and leaving headroom for the rest of the app. On a 6 GB iPhone 15 Pro, that's 600 MB–1.2 GB of cached decoded images.

## Cell reuse race conditions: the three-step fix

When a `UICollectionView` or `UITableView` cell scrolls off-screen, UIKit reuses it for new content. If an image download is in-flight for the old content, the classic race condition occurs: the old download completes after the cell is reused, and the wrong image appears — often with a visible flicker as it's overwritten by the correct image moments later.

### ❌ Incorrect: no cancellation, no clearing, no identity check

```swift
// ❌ BAD — Every line is a bug waiting to happen
class BadCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    @IBOutlet var cellImageView: UIImageView!

    func configure(with url: URL) {
        // ❌ Stale image from previous item remains visible
        // ❌ Previous download still running — wastes bandwidth
        // ❌ No identity check — wrong image will overwrite correct one

        Task { [weak self] in
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            let image = UIImage(data: data)
            self?.cellImageView.image = image  // ❌ Cell may represent a different item now
        }
    }

    // ❌ No prepareForReuse override at all
}
```

### ✅ Correct: cancel, clear, verify

```swift
// ✅ GOOD — Three-step defense against race conditions
class ImageCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    @IBOutlet var cellImageView: UIImageView!

    private var loadTask: Task<Void, Never>?
    private var currentURL: URL?

    func configure(with url: URL, cache: ImageCache = .shared) {
        currentURL = url

        // Step 0: Check cache first (synchronous, no race possible)
        if let cached = cache.image(forKey: url.absoluteString) {
            cellImageView.image = cached
            return
        }

        // Step 1: Clear stale image immediately
        cellImageView.image = nil

        // Step 2: Cancel any in-flight task from previous configuration
        loadTask?.cancel()

        // Step 3: Start new download with identity verification
        loadTask = Task { [weak self] in
            do {
                let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
                try Task.checkCancellation()

                guard let image = UIImage(data: data) else { return }
                cache.setImage(image, forKey: url.absoluteString)

                // ✅ CRITICAL: Verify this cell still represents the same URL
                guard self?.currentURL == url else { return }
                self?.cellImageView.image = image
            } catch is CancellationError {
                // Cell was reused — task correctly cancelled, do nothing
            } catch {
                // Network error handling (placeholder, retry, etc.)
            }
        }
    }

    override func prepareForReuse() {
        super.prepareForReuse()
        loadTask?.cancel()        // ✅ Cancel in-flight download
        loadTask = nil
        cellImageView.image = nil // ✅ Clear stale image
        currentURL = nil          // ✅ Reset identity tracker
    }
}
```

The three required steps in `prepareForReuse()` are: **cancel** the in-flight task, **clear** the image view, and **reset** the identity tracker. On completion, the `guard self?.currentURL == url` check is the final defense — even if cancellation didn't propagate in time, the stale result is silently discarded. The `Task.checkCancellation()` call after the network await provides an early exit if the task was cancelled during the download.

## SF Symbols: vector icons with semantic meaning

SF Symbols provides **6,000+** vector icons that scale with Dynamic Type, support multiple rendering modes, and adapt to weight and accessibility settings automatically. In UIKit, load them with `UIImage(systemName:)` and configure them with `UIImage.SymbolConfiguration`.

```swift
// Basic loading
let star = UIImage(systemName: "star.fill")

// Configured with point size, weight, and scale
let config = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(pointSize: 24, weight: .bold, scale: .large)
let configuredStar = UIImage(systemName: "star.fill", withConfiguration: config)

// Combine multiple configurations with .applying()
let sizeConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(textStyle: .headline)
let weightConfig = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(weight: .heavy)
let combined = sizeConfig.applying(weightConfig)
```

SF Symbols supports four rendering modes. **Monochrome** applies a single tint color. **Hierarchical** applies one color with varying opacity per layer for depth. **Palette** assigns distinct colors to primary, secondary, and tertiary layers. **Multicolor** uses the symbol's intrinsic colors (a green leaf, a red trash icon).

```swift
// Hierarchical — one color, layered opacity
let hierarchical = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(hierarchicalColor: .systemBlue)
imageView.image = UIImage(systemName: "person.3.fill", withConfiguration: hierarchical)

// Palette — explicit colors per layer
let palette = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration(paletteColors: [.white, .systemBlue, .systemTeal])
imageView.image = UIImage(systemName: "person.3.fill", withConfiguration: palette)

// Multicolor — intrinsic colors
let multicolor = UIImage.SymbolConfiguration.configurationPreferringMulticolor()
imageView.image = UIImage(systemName: "cloud.sun.rain.fill", withConfiguration: multicolor)
```

Set `preferredSymbolConfiguration` on a `UIImageView` to apply configuration at the view level rather than baking it into the image. iOS 16+ introduced **variable color** (`UIImage(systemName: "speaker.wave.3", variableValue: 0.5)`) for progress indicators. **SF Symbols 6** (2024) added wiggle, breathe, and rotate animation presets. **SF Symbols 7** (2025) added draw-on/draw-off animations and gradient fills.

## When third-party libraries still earn their place

Native iOS (URLSession + NSCache + ImageIO + Swift actors) can handle straightforward image loading without dependencies. **Third-party libraries become justified when your requirements exceed what native provides in a reasonable engineering budget.**

Native covers: network downloading, in-memory caching (NSCache), HTTP-level disk caching (URLCache), downsampling (ImageIO), off-main-thread decoding (iOS 15+ APIs), and thread safety (actors). It does **not** provide: configurable disk caching with expiration policies, image processing pipelines (blur, round corners, tint cached per-variant), progressive JPEG rendering, animated GIF/WebP/APNG playback, prefetch coordination, retry/authentication middleware, or transition animations.

The three leading libraries each occupy a distinct niche. **Kingfisher** (~23K GitHub stars) is the most popular pure-Swift option, offering the simplest API (`imageView.kf.setImage(with: url)`), built-in image processors that cache processed results, and excellent SwiftUI support via `KFImage`. **SDWebImage** (~25K stars) is the most mature option with Objective-C roots, the broadest animated format support, and an extensible coder plugin system for WebP, AVIF, and HEIF. **Nuke** (~8.5K stars) is the most performance-focused, featuring a composable pipeline architecture, resumable downloads, dynamic request prioritization, rate limiting, and the smallest binary footprint with sub-2-second compile times.

Choose native when your app displays fewer than ~50 images, your backend serves properly sized images, and you don't need disk caching or image transformations. Choose a library for image-heavy apps (social feeds, e-commerce catalogs, photo galleries) where the engineering cost of replicating disk caching, format support, and edge-case handling exceeds the cost of a dependency.

## The complete ImageLoader actor

This implementation combines every technique discussed: NSCache with bitmap-cost accounting, ImageIO downsampling, in-flight request deduplication, and Swift actor isolation for thread safety. No locks, no dispatch queues — the actor serializes all access to shared state automatically.

```swift
import UIKit
import ImageIO

actor ImageLoader {
    static let shared = ImageLoader()

    private let cache = NSCache<NSString, UIImage>()
    private var inFlight: [URL: Task<UIImage, Error>] = [:]

    init() {
        cache.countLimit = 150
        let memoryBudget = ProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory / 5  // 20%
        cache.totalCostLimit = Int(min(memoryBudget, UInt64(Int.max)))
    }

    // MARK: - Public API

    /// Load an image from cache, or download and optionally downsample it.
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - url: Remote image URL
    ///   - targetSize: Point size for downsampling. Pass nil for full-size decode.
    func load(from url: URL, targetSize: CGSize? = nil) async throws -> UIImage {
        let key = url.absoluteString as NSString

        // 1. Memory cache hit — instant return
        if let cached = cache.object(forKey: key) {
            return cached
        }

        // 2. De-duplicate: reuse an in-flight task for the same URL
        if let existing = inFlight[url] {
            return try await existing.value
        }

        // 3. Create download + decode task
        let task = Task<UIImage, Error> {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            try Task.checkCancellation()

            let image: UIImage
            if let size = targetSize {
                image = Self.downsample(data: data, to: size)
                    ?? UIImage(data: data)!
            } else if let full = UIImage(data: data) {
                // Decode on this background thread to avoid main-thread hitch
                image = await full.byPreparingForDisplay() ?? full
            } else {
                throw URLError(.cannotDecodeContentData)
            }
            return image
        }

        // Store BEFORE await — other callers see .inFlight and reuse this task
        inFlight[url] = task

        do {
            let image = try await task.value
            let cost = image.cgImage.map { $0.bytesPerRow * $0.height } ?? 0
            cache.setObject(image, forKey: key, cost: cost)
            inFlight[url] = nil
            return image
        } catch {
            inFlight[url] = nil
            throw error
        }
    }

    /// Cancel a pending load for a specific URL.
    func cancel(for url: URL) {
        inFlight[url]?.cancel()
        inFlight[url] = nil
    }

    /// Evict all cached images (call on memory warning).
    func clearCache() {
        cache.removeAllObjects()
    }

    // MARK: - ImageIO Downsampling (nonisolated — pure function, no shared state)

    nonisolated static func downsample(
        data: Data,
        to pointSize: CGSize,
        scale: CGFloat = UIScreen.main.scale
    ) -> UIImage? {
        let sourceOpts = [kCGImageSourceShouldCache: false] as CFDictionary
        guard let source = CGImageSourceCreateWithData(data as CFData, sourceOpts) else {
            return nil
        }
        let maxDimension = max(pointSize.width, pointSize.height) * scale
        let thumbOpts: [CFString: Any] = [
            kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailFromImageAlways: true,
            kCGImageSourceShouldCacheImmediately: true,
            kCGImageSourceCreateThumbnailWithTransform: true,
            kCGImageSourceThumbnailMaxPixelSize: maxDimension
        ]
        guard let cg = CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex(source, 0, thumbOpts as CFDictionary) else {
            return nil
        }
        return UIImage(cgImage: cg)
    }
}
```

### Integration with collection view cells

```swift
class AsyncImageCell: UICollectionViewCell {
    let imageView = UIImageView()
    private var loadTask: Task<Void, Never>?
    private var currentURL: URL?

    func configure(with url: URL, targetSize: CGSize) {
        currentURL = url
        imageView.image = nil
        loadTask?.cancel()

        loadTask = Task { [weak self] in
            do {
                let image = try await ImageLoader.shared.load(
                    from: url, targetSize: targetSize
                )
                guard !Task.isCancelled, self?.currentURL == url else { return }
                self?.imageView.image = image
            } catch {
                guard !Task.isCancelled else { return }
                self?.imageView.image = UIImage(systemName: "photo")
            }
        }
    }

    override func prepareForReuse() {
        super.prepareForReuse()
        loadTask?.cancel()
        loadTask = nil
        imageView.image = nil
        currentURL = nil
    }
}
```

The **deduplication trick** is the most subtle part of the actor design. When `load(from:)` stores the `Task` in `inFlight[url]` before awaiting `task.value`, any concurrent caller for the same URL hits the `if let existing = inFlight[url]` branch and awaits the same task. This eliminates duplicate network requests when the same image URL appears in multiple visible cells — a common scenario with user avatars.

The `downsample` method is marked `nonisolated` because it's a pure function with no shared state — it can run on any thread without actor hop overhead.

## What changed at WWDC 2024 and 2025

**WWDC 2024** introduced **Adaptive HDR** as the headline image feature. A new gain-map-based format stores both HDR and SDR representations in a single file, with new APIs like `kCGImageSourceDecodeToHDR`, `UIImageView.preferredImageDynamicRange`, and `CGImageGetContentHeadroom()`. SF Symbols 6 added **800+ new symbols** and wiggle/breathe/rotate animation presets. **Swift 6** shipped with data-race safety by default — image loading code sharing mutable state across threads must now use actors or the new `Mutex` type from the Synchronization module.

**WWDC 2025** brought **Swift 6.2's "Approachable Concurrency"** model with default `@MainActor` isolation and the `@concurrent` attribute for explicit background work — a cleaner fit for image loading patterns. SF Symbols 7 added draw-on/draw-off animations and gradient fills. `UIBackgroundExtensionView` enables images to extend seamlessly behind navigation bars in the new Liquid Glass design language. Crucially, **no new image caching or loading APIs** were introduced — `NSCache`, ImageIO downsampling, and the iOS 15 `prepareThumbnail`/`prepareForDisplay` family remain Apple's recommended toolkit.

## Conclusion

The core principle hasn't changed since WWDC 2018: **never decode more pixels than you display**. What has evolved is the ergonomics. ImageIO downsampling remains the lowest-memory option for network images arriving as raw `Data`. The iOS 15+ thumbnail APIs provide a cleaner interface when you already have a `UIImage`. Swift actors eliminate the thread-safety boilerplate that previously required dispatch queues or locks. And `NSCache` with bitmap-cost accounting gives the memory subsystem accurate information for intelligent eviction.

The ImageLoader actor pattern presented here — combining NSCache, ImageIO downsampling, in-flight deduplication, and structured concurrency — covers 80% of production image loading needs without a single dependency. The remaining 20% (disk caching with TTL, animated formats, progressive rendering, image processing pipelines) is where Kingfisher, SDWebImage, or Nuke justify their inclusion. The decision isn't native *versus* third-party — it's knowing exactly which capabilities you're buying and whether the engineering cost of building them yourself exceeds adding a well-maintained dependency.

## Summary Checklist

- [ ] Images downsampled to display size — never loaded at full resolution (12MP = ~48MB decoded)
- [ ] Downsampling uses ImageIO (`CGImageSourceCreateThumbnailAtIndex`) for maximum memory efficiency
- [ ] iOS 15+: `byPreparingThumbnail(of:)` or `prepareForDisplay()` used for async decoding when appropriate
- [ ] Cell image loading follows cancel/clear/verify pattern in `prepareForReuse`
- [ ] In-flight Task cancelled in `prepareForReuse`; `imageView.image` cleared immediately
- [ ] Completion verifies cell identity (URL/ID match) before applying image
- [ ] `NSCache` uses `totalCostLimit` based on decoded bitmap bytes (width × height × 4), not file size
- [ ] Memory warning observer calls `cache.removeAllObjects()` on `didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification`
- [ ] SF Symbols use `UIImage(systemName:)` with `SymbolConfiguration` for weight/scale/color
